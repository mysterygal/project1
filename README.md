## Telecom Churn Prediction in South Asian Market

Hi folks,Finally I am writing my first blogpost after giving so  much thought about which subject to write about,I decided to go with a full Machine learning project I recently did.
I will share the zest of all the things that I tried and what worked for me best.
I hope it will help you in developing the approach to solve similar problems.

In this blog I have tried to answer  the following questions 

1)What is  introduction to real World dataset?

2)How to convert the buisness problem to technical problem ?

3)How to decide the evaluation metrics?

4)How to decide which model is good ?

5)What can be further done to improve our model?
